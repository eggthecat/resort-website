    <h3>Travel Arrangments</h3>
    <h3>STEP 1</h3>
    <p>Choose the exact destination of your trip. Determine the exact addresses of where you will be going. Will you be traveling to multiple locations? Are there multiple airports?</p>

    <h3>STEP 2</h3>
    <p>Choose your ideal travel dates based on the activities you plan to do. If attending a business meeting or conference, consider flying into town the day before to allow plenty of time for preparation. If vacationing, think about the typical weather during the dates you wish to travel. The Caribbean is rocked by hurricanes from June to November and can put a damper on vacation plans.
